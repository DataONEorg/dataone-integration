		<div class="padded"><h3>Tier 0</h3>
		    Tier 0 is really just checking that the URL submitted will correctly get you to the 
		    your server.  If this one fails, it is usually because the url has typos or the version
		    path segment was included by mistake.  Check the error message, too, of course.
        </div>
        <div class="padded">
            <h3>Tier 1</h3>
            Tier 1 includes all of the public methods.  MNRead methods for the most part require
            prefetching an object identifier via listObjects, so if you are seeing "No Objects available
            to test against" but are sure you have objects (try an /mn/v1/object call from a browser)"
            go to the listObjects Test to see if that is working.  A failing listObjects will cause
            the "No Objects..." message even if there are objects on your node.
        </div>
        <div class="padded">
            <h3>Tier 2</h3>
            Tier 2 tests authorization and access control.  These tests attempt to prefetch objects
            that the pre-defined test subject "testUserWriter" has changePermission permission for.
            To do this, it uses listObjects() and isAuthorized(..for ChangePermission..) on 
            the returned objectList.  (At Tier2, we still cannot create objects to test with, 
            and rely on something already present and with the right accessPolicy).
             <i>However</i>, if the node under test is set up to be a Tier3 node, the tests
             will try to create an object (as the above Subject). 
        </div>
         <div class="padded">
            <h3>Tier 3</h3>
            Tier 3 tests the ability to create, update and delete objects.  The additional
            requirement for these tests is that the testUserWriter can create objects.
